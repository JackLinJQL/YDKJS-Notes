Chapter 4: Mixing (Up) "Class" Objects
  Class Theory:
    -OO stresses that data intrinsically has associated behaviour that operates
     on it, so proper design is to package up (encapsulate) the data and the behaviour
     together, known as data structure
    -E.g. series of characters known as string and you usually want to do things
     with the data, so the behaviours that can apply to that data are all designed
     as methods of a String class
    -any given string is just an instance of this class, meaning that it's a neatly
     collected packaging of both the character data and the functionality we can
     perform on it
    -classes also imply a way of classifying a certain data structure, given structure
     as a specific variation of a more general base definition
    -e.g. car as a vehicle, so class Vehicle is the parent of class Car
    -Vehicle would be all the stuff that's common to all different types of vehicles
    -polymorphism: idea that a general behavior from a parent class can be overriden
     in a child class to give it more specifics, relative polymorphism lets us reference
     the base behaviour from the overriden behaviour

    "Class" Design Pattern:
      -procedural programming: describing code which only consists of procedures (functions)
       calling other functions without any higher abstractions
      -"functional programming", classes are just one of several common design patterns
      -Java doesn't give you a choice but to have everything as classes, C/C++ or
       PHP can either be procedural or class-oriented

    JavaScript "Classes":
      -JS has some class-like syntactic elements like 'new' and 'instanceOf'
      -but JS ***does NOT*** actually have classes
      -since classes are design patterns, you can, with lots of effort implement
       approximations for much of classical class functionality
      -JS tries to satisfy the extremely pervasive desire to design with classes by
       providing seemingly class-like syntax
      -classes are optional pattern in software design, you have the choice to use them
       in JS or not

  Class Mechanics:
    -Stack class itself is not a "stack", one must instantiate the Stack class before
     you have a concrete data structure thing to operate against

    Building:
      -"class" and "instance" based thinking come from a building construction
      -architect plan out all characteristics of a building, how wide, how tall..
       and does not care where the building will be built or the number of copies
      -architectural blue-prints are only plans for a building
      -a building would then be the physical instantiation of the blue-print plans
      -class is a blueprint that can be instantiated to create an object and an
       object would then be an instance of a class
      -the object is a copy of all the characteristics described by the class
      -one does not generally use an object instance to directly access and manipulate
       its class, but usually possible to at least determine which class an object
       instance comes from
      -a class is instantiated into object form by a cope operation
