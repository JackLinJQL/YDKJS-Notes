Chapter 1: Into Programming

Statements: a group of words, number and operators that perform a specific task

Expressions: any reference to a variable or a value, or a set of variables and
             values combined with operators

Interpreting code: translation of commands done from top to bottom, line by line
                   every time the program is run
                   
Compiling code: translation is done ahead of time, when the program runs later,
                what's running is actually already compiled
                
Primitive types: number, string and boolean

Coercion: covert between different types

Implicit coercion: convert a type to another without explicitly using a wrapper

Loose equal (==): when comparing with loose equal operators, same value in two
                  different representations, two different types are equivalent
                  
Code comments: -too many comments is probably a sign of poorly written code
               -comments should explain why, not what, optionally explain how
               
Static typing: declare a variable to hold a specific type of value

Dynamic typing: allows variables to hold any type of value at any time
               
var amount = 99.99;
amount = amount * 2;
console.log( amount );		// 199.98, implicitly coerced number to string for printing

-toFixed(..) is a function that can be accessed on number values for number of
             decimal values
        
-ES6 uses const to declare constants instead of var

-In JS, values such as 0, "", false, null, undefined and NaN are considered false
