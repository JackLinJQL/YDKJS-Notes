Chapter 2: Lexical Scope

Lex-time:
-lexing aka tokenizing, examines a string of source code characters and assigns
 semantic meanings to the token as a result of some stateful parsing
-lexical scope is scope that is defined at lexing time, which is based on where
 variables and blocks of scope are authored, by you, at write time and set in
 stone by the time the lexer processed your code

Look-ups:
-scope look-up stops once it find the first match, the same identifier name can
 be specified at multiple layers of nested scope, known as shadowing (inner shadows
 the outer identifier)
-global variables are also automatically properties of the global object (window
 in browsers)
