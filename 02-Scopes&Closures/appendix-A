Appendix A: Dynamic Scope
-doesn't concern itself with how and where functions and scopes are declared, 
 but rather where they are called from, which means that the scope chain is based
 on the call-stack, not the nesting of scope in code

-but JS doesn't not use dynamic scope

-lexical scope is write-time, whereas dynamic scope (and this !) are runtime

-lexical scope cares where a function was declared, but dynamic scope cares where
 a function is called from
