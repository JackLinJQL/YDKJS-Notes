    var a;
    console.log( a ); //2

  -since engine actually compiles JS code before it interprets it, part of it
   was to find and associate all declarations with their appropriate scope
  -so the best way to think of it is that all declarations, both variables and 
   functions are processed first before any part of code is executed
  -when 'var a = 2;', JS actually thinks of it as two statements: 'var a;' and
   'a = 2;', declaration is processed during the compilation phase, assignment
   is left 'in place' for the execution phase
